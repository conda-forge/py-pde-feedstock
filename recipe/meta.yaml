  description: |
    py-pde is a Python package for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).
    The package provides classes for grids on which scalar and tensor fields can be defined.
    The associated differential operators are computed using a numba-compiled implementation of finite differences.
    This allows defining, inspecting, and solving typical PDEs that appear for instance in the study of dynamical systems in physics.
    The focus of the package lies on easy usage to explore the behavior of PDEs.
    However, core computations can be compiled transparently using numba for speed.
